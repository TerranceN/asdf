ASDF
####

A tool to search through your history.

I use iterm2, so if you don't things might break? I dunno.

If this doesn't work for you, too bad.

Usage
-----

In a terminal, type `asdf`, then type a search string.

Up/Down arrows -> Select a result
Left           -> Delete the selected command from your history
Right          -> Prefil your command prompt with the selected command
